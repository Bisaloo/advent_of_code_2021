X increases depth X units. X decreases depth X units. Note since \\'re submarine, affect depth, opposite result might expect. submarine seems already planned course (puzzle x). probably figure \\'s going. example: horizontal position depth start 0. steps modify follows: forward 5 adds 5 horizontal position, total 5. 5 adds 5 depth, resulting value 5. forward 8 adds 8 horizontal position, total 13. 3 decreases depth 3, resulting value 2. 8 adds 8 depth, resulting value 10. forward 2 adds 2 horizontal position, total 15. following instructions, horizontal position 15 depth 10.

Part Two Based calculations, planned course seem make sense. find submarine manual discover process actually slightly complicated. addition horizontal position depth, also need track third value, aim, also starts 0. commands also mean something entirely different first thought: X increases aim X units. X decreases aim X units. forward X two things: increases horizontal position X units. increases depth aim multiplied X. note since submarine, opposite might expect: \"\" means aiming positive direction. Now, example something different: forward 5 adds 5 horizontal position, total 5. aim 0, depth change. 5 adds 5 aim, resulting value 5. forward 8 adds 8 horizontal position, total 13. aim 5, depth increases 8*5=40. 3 decreases aim 3, resulting value 2. 8 adds 8 aim, resulting value 10. forward 2 adds 2 horizontal position, total 15. aim 10, depth increases 2*10=20 total 60. following new instructions, horizontal position 15 depth 60.
